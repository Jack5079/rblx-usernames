# rblx-usernames

A list of usernames I found from Roblox.

Names gathed by using the BTRoblox extension, and loading in as many names from https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1192464705/Bear-Face-Mask as I could.

After that, I ran this snippet in the Console:
```js
copy([...document.getElementsByClassName('username')].map(ele=>ele.innerText))
```
